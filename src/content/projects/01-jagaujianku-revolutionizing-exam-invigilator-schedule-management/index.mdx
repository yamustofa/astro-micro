## The Challenge of Exam Invigilator Schedules

As a former exam invigilator myself, I've personally experienced the frustrations of managing schedules. Typically, invigilators receive their assignments in a static PDF table from the faculty. While functional, this format offers no dynamic way to track progress, manage tasks, or gain a quick overview of one's responsibilities. This often leads to manual note-taking, potential oversight, and a lack of a centralized system for personal schedule management.

## Introducing Jagaujianku: Your Digital Invigilator Assistant

To address these pain points, I developed **Jagaujianku** (available at [jagaujianku.pages.dev](https://jagaujianku.pages.dev/)). This web application is designed with one main goal: to empower exam invigilators by transforming their static PDF schedules into an interactive, manageable to-do list.

### How Jagaujianku Works:

1.  **Effortless Upload:** Users can easily upload their PDF schedule directly to the application.
2.  **Intelligent Extraction:** Leveraging the power of the Gemini API, Jagaujianku intelligently extracts the relevant data from the uploaded PDF table. This means no more manual data entry!
3.  **Dynamic To-Do List Creation:** The extracted data is then transformed into a personalized, actionable to-do list. Each exam session becomes a task that can be managed.
4.  **Track Progress & Earn Points:**
    *   Invigilators can check off tasks as they complete them.
    *   A unique gamification element is introduced: completing tasks earns points. This adds a layer of motivation and engagement.
    *   Users can view their progress at a glance, including:
        *   Total tasks assigned
        *   Tasks completed
        *   Total points collected
        *   A clear list of all checklist tasks

## Why Jagaujianku Matters

Jagaujianku isn't just about digitizing a schedule; it's about enhancing efficiency, reducing stress, and providing a clear overview for invigilators. By automating the data extraction and providing an interactive interface, it frees up valuable time and ensures that no assignment is overlooked. The point system also offers a novel way to acknowledge and motivate the hard work of invigilators.

This project was born out of a real-world problem I encountered, and I believe it offers a practical and effective solution for educational institutions and their dedicated invigilators.
